With the merging of machine learning with circuits and mechanics, we can actually create robots that can display similar attributes and characteristics to humans in being able to arrive at a solution to a problem provided there is available data to learn from. We can also observe how machine learning is dominating the industry in terms on what we use our phones to do all the time. When we access the internet, we are using the result of a machine learning algorithm whether directly or indirectly.',

Such abilities are exibited in the technology we can see today such as self driving cars, classification of emails into spam and non-spam, autonomous robotics etc. We are still in the age of ANI, but we are fast evolving into AGI. ",
        words3:"Artificial General Intelligence is a science whereby the intelligence of machines is expected to be on par with that of humans. However there have been some limitations with scientists achieving this feat because there is always a problem with computation and algorithms, because a machine cannot do outside what it has been programed or trained to do. Further research is being done in order to achieve this feat.",
